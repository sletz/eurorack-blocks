# Your First Module

For our first module, we will make a simple low-pass filter, with one big knob to control
the cut off frequency.

First create your new project by creating a directory and populating it with a simple template.

You can create your project wherever you see fit. In this example, we created it in our
home folder.

```shell-session
~$ mkdir LowPass
~$ cd LowPass
~/LowPass$ erbb max init LowPass
~/LowPass$ erbb configure
```

If you are using Xcode open `project_vcvrack.xcodeproj` in the `artifacts` folder.

```{note}
In the following source code files, we have removed all comments to
keep the file easy to read for this tutorial.
```

Let's now add the pot with a big knob, by editing the `Lowpass.erbui` file,
as highlighted in the following `erbui` source code:

```{code-block} erbui
---
lineno-start: 1
emphasize-lines: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
---
// LowPass.erbui

module LowPass {
   width 12hp
   board kivu12
   material aluminum
   header { label "LowPass" }

   control freq Pot {
      position 6hp, 34mm
      style rogan.6ps
      label "FREQ"
   }

   control audio_in AudioIn {
      position 4hp, 96mm
      style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
      label "IN"
   }

   control audio_in2 AudioIn {
      position 8hp, 96mm
      style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
      label "IN"
   }

   control audio_out AudioOut {
      position 4hp, 111mm
      style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
      label "OUT"
   }

   control audio_out2 AudioOut {
      position 8hp, 111mm
      style thonk.pj398sm.knurled
      label "OUT"
   }
}
```

- 9: Add a pot and give it the name `freq` (we will see how names are used later)
- 10: Give it a position, first is on the horizontal axis, and second is on the vertical axis.
   Note that both have units, with `hp` being the Eurorack HP for convenience.
   Since half of 12HP is 6HP, this will place the pot at the horizontal center in the module
- 11: Let's give it a style, which here is the knob style. `rogan.6ps` is the name of the knob used
   in many Mutable Instruments and Make Noise modules
- 12: Give it an optional label, which will be printed on the front panel aluminum

You can already build the project using {guilabel}`âŒ˜B` and run VCV Rack to see what it looks like.

You can connect inputs and outputs, and you can hear that the input goes on the output
but moving the FREQ knob doesn't have any effect.

Let's now take care of this. 

Open the LowPass Max patch in Max.
